## Summary

For this project, I looked at a dataset that included patient information on factors that may be associated with cervical cancer risk.  I explored the factors of age, hormonal contraception, HPV diagnosis, number of pregnancies and smoking habits.  What I found in my research is that there seems to be a strong relationship between a women being HPV positive and cervical cancer risk.  Additionally, age and having been pregnant at least one time seem to have a positive correlation with cervical cancer risk.  The use of hormonal contraceptives had a slightly positive correlation to cervical cancer risk but I would like to run statistical analysis on this data to see if the differences were significant.



## Insights

I do not feel I had enough information to say if there was a relationship between smoking and cervical cancer risk.  Of the patients that were diagnosed with cervical cancer, only two were smokers.  This could suggest that there is no relationship between these two variables but I would recommend looking at a larger dataset before drawing any conclusions in regards to these two variables.

I was surprised to see that there seemed to be a strong relatitonship between whether or not a woman had ever been pregnant and cervical cancer risk.  I decided to explore this relationship when I was looking at the relationship of age and cervical cancer diagnosis.  I discovered there was a high number of positive cervical cancer diagnosises during average childbearing years (ages 20 - 40).  I decided to do a Part-to-Whole Donut chart to see if there was a larger number of women having a positive cervical cancer diagnosis with each increase in the number of pregnancies.  I discovered that there does seem to be a slighty positive relationship between the number of pregnancies and cervical cancer diagnosis. There did seem to be a significant absence in cervical cancer diagnosises for women who had never been pregnant(0 pregnancies).  In order to more clearly show this relationship I will display the information in a scatter plot.
